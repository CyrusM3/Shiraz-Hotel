            As we continue to grow, we don’t lose sight of what’s most
            important—people. Shiraz is a company that was built by family. It’s
            a workplace where coworkers become friends. Every day we care for
            our guests. Care is at the heart of our business, and it’s this
            distinct guest experience that makes Shiraz one of the world’s best
            hospitality brands.

            We loved staying at this hotel. Staffs are very friendly and very
            helpful. The gentleman name RUI at the parking and door service is
            very genuine and a good person. His service was fantastic.

            Check in was great and we got an awesome room with a great view of
            the mountain on the 3rd floor. Everything was clean and comfortable
            and the staff were quite friendly and responsive. It was too bad
            that room service was still unavailable but aside from that it was a
            great stay. I’ve stayed at this hotel before and will definitely
            stay again!
